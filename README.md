# watermarking_effects_on_classification

VGG16 and MobileNet V1 are trained on CIFAR 10 and evaluated with watermraked images <br />
VGG16.ipynb- trained VGGnetwork with val_accuracy of 71% tested on images taken from internet<br />
cifar10mobilenet.ipynb-trained MobileNet with val_accuracy of 81% tested on images taken from internet<br />
mobilenet_final.ipynb- mobilenet tested on watermarked images in Fourier domain<br />
mobilenet_lightwatermark.ipynb- tested with spatial domain watermark with transparency of 0.1<br />
mobilenet_heavywatermark.ipynb-tested with spatial domain watermark with transparency 0.5 <br />
The watermark image used is a cat image which is also one of the classification classes <br />
